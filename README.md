# Quake Rescue AI

**Quake Rescue AI** is an open-source project that aims to support post-earthquake search and rescue operations using AI-driven insights and 3D modeling. By combining architectural data with real-time 3D scans of collapsed buildings, the system predicts the most likely locations of trapped individuals, helping rescue teams act faster and more effectively.
